# Napoleon-Website

This is the code for a website that was designed for users to be able to learn about Napoleon.

It makes use of EJS templating and Express to handle the backend, and uses Nodemailer to send users emails when they sign up to a mailing list. 

It also gets data from a quotes.net API, so that every time the user goes to the homepage, a random quote from Napoleon is published at the bottom.

This project was built in 2021, but only uploaded recently
